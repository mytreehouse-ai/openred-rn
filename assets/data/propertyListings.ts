It strikes a balance, being close enough to Metro Manila for convenience yet distant enough to escape the hectic pace of the capital. Access between the two locales is approximately an hour&#039;s drive via the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and the Pan-Philippine Highway.As of 2020, Bulacan housed a population of around 3.7 million, distributed across three cities and 21 municipalities. It is well-connected by the MacArthur Highway and NLEX, facilitating links to the Metro. Local transportation, typical of many urban areas in the Philippines, includes jeepneys, taxis, and tricycles. Numerous bus lines originating from the capital pass through Bulacan en route to destinations such as Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales. Notably, one of Luzon&#039;s major bus companies, Baliwag Transit Incorporated, has its headquarters in the Baliuag municipality.Reservation fee: 1999Financing/Payment Terms: Pag-ibig, In-house",

        "Location: JP Cabaguio Avenue, Agdao, Davao City, Davao del SurLot Size: Around 1,200 Sq.M. (frontage is about 24 meters)Development Prospects: Can be leased as a vacant lot. May also be leased as a package with a built-to-suit (BTS) warehouse. The indicative warehouse floor area footprint can be around 840 Sq.M. (at 70% structure to open area ratio). To maximize space, a mezzanine office can be included in the structure (around 84 sq.m. to 100 sq.m.) which would make the total floor area around 924 to 940 Sq.M., or a little larger at lessee&#039;s option.Lease Rate: P80/sq.m. for vacant lot (negotiable). For discussion for BTS warehouse. Direct Lessees Only please.Please send us your inquiries thru text or email so we can provide additional details and assistance on site inspection.",
